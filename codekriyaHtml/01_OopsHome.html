		<b>Encapsulation:</b>
		<br/>
		In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers 
		to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. Many programming 
		languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.

	<div class = "row normaltext">
		<b>Abstraction:</b>
		<br/>
        Abstraction is commonly defined as the extraction of relevant information from a larger data set, where utilizing 
		abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify a codebase.
	</div>
	
	
	<div class = "row normaltext">
		<b>Inheritance:</b>
		<br/>
		Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class 
		whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties 
		from the parent class is the Child class.
