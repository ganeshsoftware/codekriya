				Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated 
				by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by humans or by other animals. Example tasks in which this 
				is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as 
				other mappings of inputs. AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), 
				recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri 
				and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), 
				automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess 
				and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often 
				removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character 
				recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
