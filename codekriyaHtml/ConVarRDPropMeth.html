	<h2>Constants, Variables, ReadOnlys, Properties and Methods.</h2>
	Constants, Variables, ReadOnlys, Properties and Methods are the buidling blocks of any programs which are resident 
	either in a class or in struct.

<p>
	<h4>Constants</h4>
	Constants are immutable values which are known at compile time and do not change for the life of 
	the program. Constants are declared with the const modifier. Only the C# built-in types (excluding 
	System.Object) may be declared as const.
	Important: User-defined types, including classes, structs, and arrays, cannot be const.They can be only readonlys for that. 
</p>

<p>
	<h4>Variables</h4>
	A variable or scalar is a storage address (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated 
	symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. 
	The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the 
	variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be 
	used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code 
	can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the 
	course of program execution.
</p>

<p>
	<h4>Read-Onlys</h4>
	In c#, readonly is a keyword which is useful to define read-only fields in our applications.  The 
	read-only field values need to be initialized either at the declaration or in a constructor of the 
	same class unlike constant keyword in c#. If we use readonly keyword with fields, then those field 
	values will be evaluated at the runtime.
</p>


<p>
	<h4></h4>
	To define read-only fields in c#, we need to use readonly keyword during the declaration of fields in our 
	application and we can use readonly modifier with the numbers, boolean values, strings or with null references.
</p>


<p>
<h4></h4>	
If we use readonly keyword to define the read-only field, then that field value cannot be changed once the 
constructor execution has finished so we should not use readonly keyword with the fields whose value will be 
changed at any time. Itâ€™s mandatory to initialize read-only field values either at the declaration or in a 
constructor otherwise we will get compile-time errors in our c# application.
</p>



<p>
	<h4>Properties</h4>
	A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. 
	Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called accessors. 
	This enables data to be accessed easily and still helps promote the safety and flexibility of methods.

	<ol>
		<li>)
			Properties enable a class to expose a public way of getting and setting values, 
			while hiding implementation or verification code.
		</li>
		<li>)
			A get property accessor is used to return the property value, and a set property accessor is used to assign 
			a new value. These accessors can have different access levels. For more information, see Restricting 
			Accessor Accessibility.
		</li>
		<li>)
			The value keyword is used to define the value being assigned by the set accessor.
		</li>
		<li>)
			Properties can be read-write (they have both a get and a set accessor), read-only (they have a get accessor 
			but no set accessor), or write-only (they have a set accessor, but no get accessor). Write-only properties 
			are rare and are most commonly used to restrict access to sensitive data.
		</li>
		<li>)
			Simple properties that require no custom accessor code can be implemented either as expression body definitions 
			or as auto-implemented properties.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>




<p>
	<h4>Methods</h4>
	A method is a code block that contains a series of statements. A program causes the statements to be 
	executed by calling the method and specifying any required method arguments. In C#, every executed instruction 
	is performed in the context of a method. The Main method is the entry point for every C# application and it's 
	called by the common language runtime (CLR) when the program is started.
