<h1>Asynchronous Programming</h1>

<p>
Asynchronous programming is a type of parallel computer programming that enables a 
process to run separately from the primary application thread, or the basic set of 
instructions that the operating system is responsible for executing. It then notifies 
the thread when the task concludes. Asynchronous programming often helps reduce or 
prevent wait times or lags in computer programming by enabling processes to continue 
to run in the background of the primary application. 

For example, it may prevent a cursor from taking the time to load, allowing a user 
to complete actions within the application more quickly.

<p>
Blocking in asynchronous programming is when a website or browser is no longer able to 
continue a function and can't perform any tasks until the processor regains control. 
A frozen web page or app is a typical example of blocking. Threads in asynchronous 
programming often handle single tasks at one time in sequential order, but it's also 
possible for to have multiple threads. Multiple threads are often prevalent in systems 
with more than one core and processor. They can allow you to program language across 
several threads and accomplish more tasks at the same time.

<h2>When to use Asynchronous</h2>


<h4>Loading or downloading data</h4>
Asynchronous programming can help you load or download data when opening, executing or 
saving an application. For example, you might log in on a digital timecard application 
by clicking the clock-in button. With asynchronous programming, other information can 
upload while the clock-in task completes, like your hours for previous days in the week 
or your monthly total of hours worked. 



<h4>Running longer programs</h4>
Consider using asynchronous programming if you have several tasks that you want the 
application to operate. This allows you to complete multiple tasks at once since 
it isn't necessary for the application to wait to complete them individually. 
Consider learning about the .NET framework to help you in implementing asynchronous 
programming. This framework is an open-source software development framework that 
you can use for a variety of applications. 


<h4>Minimizing idle time</h4>
You can minimize how much idle time there is between tasks or within a single task 
using asynchronous programming. For example, if you requested information from three 
separate servers, synchronous programming would execute the request one by one instead 
of all at once. With asynchronous programming, you may receive the information quickly 
from the first server but experience a lag with the second. This type of programming 
can make it easier for you to discard the second server to gain the data you need 
from the third server by allowing you to switch tasks to minimize idle time.


<h4>Improving operations</h4>
Asynchronous programming can help systems run more effectively by preventing long 
wait times, making it useful for certain tasks. For example, if a task you want to 
perform uses a lot of input and output, asynchronous programming lets other tasks 
run or execute, whereas synchronous programming would create a time block. 
A time block represents the time it takes for a system to complete a single task 
before it can begin another. Event-driven programming or tasks that run similar 
processes can often benefit from asynchronous coding.



<h4>Visualizing the action</h4>
Many mobile applications use asynchronous programming to prevent an idle screen and 
show users that action is happening. For example, a customer making an online purchase 
might notice a graphic, logo or message on the screen after entering their credit 
card information. The visual display arises while the credit card data corresponds 
to the database and processes the payment.


<h2>Benefits of asynchronous programming</h2>

<ol>

<li>
    <b>It provides an improved user experience</b>. Asynchronous programming can improve 
    the overall user  experience since it helps systems run more efficiently. It helps 
    reduce wait times, which often  inconvenience customers.
</li>

<li>
    <b>It helps improve an application's performance.</b> This type of programming can 
    also help improve an application's speed, responsiveness and overall performance. 
    For example, it can change the user interface (UI) of an application and make it 
    easier for a customer to input their credit card information for a purchase while 
    also assigning shipping information and placing the order simultaneously.
</li>

<li>
    <b>It's possible to apply it to many coding types.</b> While asynchronous programming 
    can make coding more complex, it's possible to apply the technique to a variety of 
    languages with different syntaxes. Some of these include Java, JavaScript, 
    Typescript and Dart.
