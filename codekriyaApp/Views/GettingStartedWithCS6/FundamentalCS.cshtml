<h3>CSharp Points</h3>
<p> 
    C# (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms.
    C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, 
    generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
</p> 

<p> 
    The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later 
    approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. 
    Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. 
    At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source 
    project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# 
    programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn 
    (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, 
    open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.

<p> 
    As of November 2022, the most recent stable version of the language is C# 11.0, which was released in 
    2022 in .NET 7.0.

<h3>Design Goals</h3>

The Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#:

<ol>
    <li>
    The language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming 
    language.
    </li>
 
    <li>
    The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering 
    principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use 
    uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness, durability, 
    and programmer productivity are important.
    </li>

    <li>
    The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for deployment in 
    distributed environments.Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially 
    those already familiar with C and C++.
    </li>

    <li>
    Support for internationalization is very important.C# is intended to be suitable for writing 
    applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use 
    sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions.
    </li>

    <li>
    Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and processing 
    power requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly on performance and size 
    with C or assembly language.
    </li>
</ol>
