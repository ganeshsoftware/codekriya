A web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other over the internet. It enables the exchange of data and functionality between systems, enabling developers to access and use certain features or resources provided by a web service.

Web APIs are commonly used for building client-server applications, where the client (such as a web browser or a mobile app) sends requests to a server and receives responses containing the requested data or instructions. The server exposes a set of API endpoints that define the available operations and the structure of data that can be sent or received.

Web APIs are typically based on standard protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and use various data formats for communication, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). They can provide a wide range of functionalities, including retrieving data from a database, performing calculations, creating or modifying resources, and more.

Web APIs have become an integral part of modern web development and are used extensively to integrate different systems, services, and platforms. They enable developers to leverage existing functionalities and data sources, build scalable applications, and foster interoperability between software components.
