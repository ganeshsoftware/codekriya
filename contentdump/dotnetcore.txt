.NET Core is a free, open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern, scalable, and high-performance applications. It is a successor to the .NET Framework and provides a modular and lightweight platform that can be used to develop applications for various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The key features of .NET Core include:

1. Cross-platform compatibility: .NET Core allows developers to build applications that can run on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides a unified development experience regardless of the target platform.

2. High performance: .NET Core is designed to deliver excellent performance by utilizing just-in-time (JIT) compilation and optimizing runtime execution. It also includes the ability to leverage hardware-specific features for performance improvements.

3. Modular architecture: .NET Core follows a modular approach where the framework is divided into individual components called NuGet packages. This allows developers to include only the required components, resulting in smaller application footprints and improved performance.

4. Support for modern application types: .NET Core supports various types of applications, including web applications, microservices, command-line tools, and cloud-based applications. It provides libraries, frameworks, and tools for building applications in different domains.

5. Open-source and community-driven: .NET Core is developed as an open-source project and is supported by a vibrant community of developers. The source code is available on GitHub, allowing developers to contribute, report issues, and suggest improvements.

6. Language interoperability: .NET Core supports multiple programming languages, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic. Developers can choose their preferred language for building applications while leveraging the common runtime and libraries provided by .NET Core.

7. Tooling and ecosystem: .NET Core provides a rich set of development tools, including the cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, and command-line tools. It also has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and extensions that enhance developer productivity.

Overall, .NET Core offers a modern, flexible, and cross-platform framework for building a wide range of applications, empowering developers to create robust and efficient software solutions.
